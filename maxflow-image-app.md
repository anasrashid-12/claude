# Maxflow Image App - Shopify AI Image Processing Project Proposal

## Project Overview

We're seeking an experienced full-stack developer to architect, develop, and deploy a Shopify app that provides AI-powered image processing capabilities for e-commerce stores. 
## Technical Stack Requirements

### Frontend
- **NextJS** - Embedded Shopify app interface
- **Authentication** - Shopify OAuth integration
- **Security** - All API requests routed through NextJS backend
- **UI/UX** - Modern, responsive design suitable for Shopify Admin

### Backend
- **Python** - Primary backend language
- **Rate Limiting** - Implement robust rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **API Architecture** - RESTful APIs with proper error handling
- **Security** - JWT authentication, input validation, CORS configuration
- **Redis** - In-memory store for rate limiting and task queue management
- **Celery** - Distributed task queue for background image processing

### Database
- **Supabase** - Primary database for storing user data, image metadata, and processing history
- **File Storage** - Image backup and version management
- **Real-time Features** - Progress tracking for bulk operations

### Development Preferences
- **AI Coding Tools** - We prefer consultants who leverage AI coding assistants (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to accelerate development
- **Modern Development Practices** - TypeScript, proper error handling, comprehensive logging

## Core Functionality (Phase 1)

### 1. Shopify Integration
- **Store Connection** - Seamless OAuth connection to Shopify stores
- **Product Image Reading** - Fetch product images from Shopify API
- **Bulk Operations** - Handle multiple products/images efficiently
- **Sync Management** - Two-way synchronization with Shopify catalog

### 2. Image Management
- **Backup System** - Store original copies for revert capability
- **Version Control** - Track image modifications and history
- **Preview System** - Before/after comparisons
- **Selective Processing** - Individual or bulk image selection

### 3. AI Processing Pipeline
- **Background Removal** - Integration with custom AI API (details to be provided)
- **Image Rescaling** - Smart resizing maintaining aspect ratios
- **Quality Optimization** - Compression and format optimization
- **Batch Processing** - Queue management for bulk operations

### 4. User Interface
- **Dashboard** - Overview of processing statistics and recent activity
- **Image Gallery** - Grid view of products with processing status
- **Processing Queue** - Real-time status of ongoing operations
- **Settings Panel** - Configuration for default processing options

## Architecture Requirements

### Security & Performance
- **Rate Limiting** - Implement per-user and global rate limits
- **Authentication Flow** - Secure Shopify session validation
- **API Security** - Request validation and sanitization
- **Caching Strategy** - Efficient image and metadata caching
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback

### Scalability Considerations
- **Async Processing** - Non-blocking image processing operations with Celery
- **Queue Management** - Redis-backed Celery queues for reliable task processing
- **Database Optimization** - Efficient queries and indexing
- **CDN Integration** - Fast image delivery
- **Rate Limiting** - Redis-based distributed rate limiting across multiple instances

## Deliverables

### Phase 1 Deliverables
1. **Architecture Documentation** - System design and API specifications
2. **Shopify App Setup** - App registration and OAuth configuration
3. **NextJS Frontend** - Complete embedded app interface
4. **Python Backend** - API services with rate limiting
5. **Supabase Integration** - Database schema and migrations
6. **AI API Integration** - Connection to provided image processing API
7. **Testing Suite** - Basic tests - no need for extensive test setup for MVP
8. **Deployment Guide** - Production deployment instructions

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Database schema documentation
- Deployment and maintenance guides
- User manual for app functionality
