3. **Important**: Set `REDIS_URL` to your Redis URL from Step 2
4. Make sure to use the same `JWT_SECRET` for both backend and frontend

### 3.3 Deploy Backend

1. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python FastAPI app
2. Click "Deploy Now"
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. **Note the generated URL** (e.g., `https://your-backend.railway.app`)

## üîÑ Step 4: Deploy Celery Worker

### 4.1 Create Celery Service

1. In the same Railway project, click "Add Service"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose the same repository
4. **Important**: Select the `backend` directory as the source

### 4.2 Configure Celery Environment

1. In the Variables tab, add all Celery environment variables listed above
2. **Important**: Set `REDIS_URL` to your Redis URL from Step 2

### 4.3 Configure Celery Build Settings

Railway should automatically detect Python, but verify these settings:

- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `celery -A app.celery_app:celery_app worker --loglevel=info -Q image_queue,polling_queue`

### 4.4 Deploy Celery

1. Click "Deploy Now"
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Verify the Celery worker is running by checking logs

## üé® Step 5: Deploy Frontend

### 5.1 Create Frontend Project

1. Create a **new** Railway project
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose the same repository
4. **Important**: Select the `frontend` directory as the source

### 5.2 Configure Frontend Environment

1. In the Variables tab, add all frontend environment variables listed above
2. **Important**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to your backend URL from Step 3
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL` to your frontend URL (Railway will provide this)

### 5.3 Configure Build Settings

Railway should automatically detect Next.js, but verify these settings:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Output Directory**: `.next`

### 5.4 Deploy Frontend

1. Click "Deploy Now"
2. Wait for build and deployment to complete
3. **Note the generated URL** (e.g., `https://your-frontend.railway.app`)

## üîó Step 6: Configure Shopify App

### 6.1 Update App URLs

1. Go to your [Shopify Partner Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Navigate to your app
3. Go to "App Setup" ‚Üí "App URLs"
4. Update the following:

```
App URL: https://your-frontend.railway.app
Allowed redirection URLs:
- https://your-frontend.railway.app/auth/callback
- https://your-frontend.railway.app/auth/toplevel
```

### 6.2 Configure Webhooks

1. In your app settings, go to "Webhooks"
2. Add webhook endpoints pointing to your backend:
   - URL: `https://your-backend.railway.app/webhooks/shopify`
   - Events: Select the events you need

## ‚úÖ Step 7: Test Your Deployment

### 7.1 Test Frontend
1. Visit your frontend URL
2. Verify the page loads without errors
3. Check browser console for any issues

2. Verify the OAuth flow works
3. Check that you can access the dashboard

### 7.3 Test Features
1. Upload an image
2. Verify processing works
3. Check real-time updates
4. Test credit system

### 7.4 Test Background Tasks
1. Upload an image that requires processing
2. Check Celery worker logs to ensure tasks are being processed
3. Verify the image status updates in real-time

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check Railway logs for:
- Missing environment variables
- Node.js/Python version issues
- Build command errors
- Dependency installation failures
```

#### Authentication Issues
- Verify Shopify app URLs are correct
- Check redirect URLs in Partner Dashboard
- Ensure backend is accessible from frontend
- Verify JWT_SECRET is the same across services

#### Celery Tasks Not Processing
- Ensure Celery worker is running
- Check Redis connection
- Verify queue names match (`image_queue`, `polling_queue`)
- Check Celery worker logs for errors

#### Real-time Not Working
- Verify Supabase configuration
- Check network connectivity
- Review browser console for errors
- Ensure Supabase realtime is enabled

#### Redis Connection Issues
- Verify Redis URL is correct
- Check Redis service is running
- Ensure Redis URL is accessible from both backend and Celery

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Railway logs for each service
railway logs --service frontend
railway logs --service backend
railway logs --service celery
railway logs --service redis

# View environment variables
railway variables

# Restart deployment
railway up

# Check service status
railway status
```

### Service-Specific Debugging

#### Frontend Issues
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --service frontend

# Verify environment variables
railway variables --service frontend
```

#### Backend Issues
```bash
# Check API logs
railway logs --service backend

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/health
```

#### Celery Issues
```bash
# Check Celery worker logs
railway logs --service celery

# Verify Celery is processing tasks
# Look for messages like "Received task: app.tasks.image_tasks.submit_job_task"
```

#### Redis Issues
```bash
# Check Redis logs
railway logs --service redis

# Test Redis connection
# The backend and Celery services should show successful Redis connections
```
